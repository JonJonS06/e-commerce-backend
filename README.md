## Description

In this application we were tasked to create the back end for an e-commerce site by taking a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

First you will need to verify that you have Node.js and MySQL installed on your machine.

Next you will need to clone the repository using:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/JonJonS06/e-commerce-backend.git
```

Next you will need to install the dependencies:

```terminal
npm init --y
```

```terminal
npm install express sequelize mysql2
```

Open MySQL shell in the terminal and enter:

```terminal
source db/schema.sql;
```

and

```terminal
use ecommerce_db;
```

Once that is complete you will "quit" to exit out of MySQL.

Now you need to seed your database using the following command:

```terminal
npm run seed
```

To start the server listening:

```terminal
npm start
```

Now you can open Insomnia on your machine and test the routes created.
